This is my latest code for the robot. It should contain shooter code, driving code, elevator code, dogleg code, Voltage test code, and the current (as in the electrical term) code in testPeriodic(), near the bottom of the robot.java.

A problem with the code is that in testPeriodic(), the line of code that gets the values from the drive stick to drive the robot is incomplete, and commented out in a block comment.
